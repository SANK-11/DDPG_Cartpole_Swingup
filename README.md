# DDPG on CartPole-Swingup --- Reinforcement Learning 

## Overview

This project trains a Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) agent on
the dm_control CartPole-Swingup task using Stable-Baselines3, Shimmy,
and Gymnasium wrappers. The objective is to swing the pole upward from
the hanging position and balance it upright using continuous torque
control. Training is performed across three different seeds, and the
final results include training logs, evaluation videos, and a minimalist
learning curve plot.

## Algorithm: DDPG

DDPG (Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient) is an off-policy actor--critic
reinforcement learning algorithm designed for continuous action spaces.
It uses: - A deterministic actor network\
- A critic network to estimate Q-values\
- Gaussian noise for exploration\
- Target networks for stabilization

DDPG is sensitive to noise and hyperparameters, which makes seed
comparison especially important.

## Training Setup

-   Environment: `dm_control/cartpole-swingup-v0`
-   Algorithm: DDPG
-   Timesteps: \~200,000 per seed
-   Seeds: `0`, `1`, `2`
-   Noise: NormalActionNoise (σ = 0.1)

## Evaluation Videos

A deterministic evaluation is performed using a fixed seed (e.g.,
seed= 0,1,2). The RecordVideo wrapper saves evaluation episodes as MP4
files.

## Learning Curve

A minimalist training curve is generated using the logged monitor
files.

## Performance Notes


DDPG learns the swingup task by: 
1. Exploring with noisy actions to
build momentum\
2. Discovering a trajectory that swings the pole upward\
3. Using precise torque control to stabilize the pole

DDPG typically performs decently on this task but is less stable
compared to SAC or TD3.
